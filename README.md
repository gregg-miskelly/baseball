# About this repo
This repository is the home of a C# class library (.dll) for parsing baseball statistics data files and doing basic analysis with them.

This library is very much a work-in-progress.

There is also an example program that consumes the class library.

# Why does this library exist?
I created this library for two reasons:
1. I like C#, I love baseball, and I thought it would be fun to be able to dabble in statistical analysis in a language that I know very well.
2. I wanted to teach my son some real programming, I wanted to teach him in a general purpose language like C#, and he loves baseball, so I thought this might be a fun area for him to play.
